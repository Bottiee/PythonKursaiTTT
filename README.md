# TicTacToeAssignment
The game was made with the assignment in mind, so it is not a complete game.
A lot of functionality will eventually be added, but for now it is just a simple game.
The shader was grabbed from _**[ReactBits](https://www.reactbits.dev/)**_ and refactored with AI from Java into Python.
It also was made into PyQt5 and then refactored into Kivy. It was a pain.
## This has been a learning venture with the help of every piece of informative media I could find, ranging from, but not limited to:
* #### Google
* #### ChatGPT
* #### YouTube
* #### StackOverflow
* #### Reddit
* #### Kivy Documentation
* #### Caffeine filled delusions
* #### And many more
