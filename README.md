# TicTacToeAssignment
The game was made with the assignment in mind, so it is not a complete game.
A lot of functionality will eventually be added, but for now it is just a simple game.
The shader was grabbed from _**[ReactBits](https://www.reactbits.dev/)**_ and refactored with AI from Java into Python.
It also was made into PyQt5 and then refactored into Kivy. It was a pain.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the game with: `python Kivy_GUI_TTT/Start_game.py` (or download the .exe from the releases section)

## Features
- Kivy-based GUI
- Supports [3x3/5x5] grid sizes
- Player vs Player (more advanced CPU coming soon)

## Project Structure
- `Kivy_GUI_TTT/` — GUI implementation using Kivy
- `Decorations/` — Contains shader files
- `Game_history/` — Game state persistence
- `Logic/` — Game logic components
- `Menu/` — Main menu and screen management
- `Start_game.exe` — Windows executable (optional)
